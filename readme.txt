== Description ==

This plugin serves as a place to implement most global customizations that need to be made to the Outreach Pro (or any Genesis-based) theme for use in the UMW ecosystem.

The main function of this plugin is to implement the global header and footer used throughout the site, but other more minor customizations are also included.
